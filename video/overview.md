 ## Eye gaze
- Gaze position controls mouse
- Head motion does fine precision control
- Clicks on foot pedals
  - No mouse buttons so that is why needed

## Keyboard
- Using a Kinesis Advantage 2
  - Very ergonomic, good usage of thumbs
  - Has good macro support
- When pressing down the left foot every key one the keyboard turns into a macro
  - This mostly removes the need to press more than one key at once, reduces hand strain
- Use Colemak Mod DH - better layout than qwerty
  - Still use normal layout on a qwerty keyboard. Body is able to remember both and no issues switching. I don't touch type qwerty (and do colemak) so maybe that's why there is no confusion of muscle memory.
