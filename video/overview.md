## Overview

- State the goal & overview of this interaction system (see README.md)
- 

## Eye gaze
- Gaze position controls mouse
- Head motion does fine precision control
- Clicks on foot pedals
  - No mouse buttons so that is why needed

Demo of running of the explore interaction app, including the debug overlay showing what the eye tracking is doing.

Demo of dragging files around on the desktop, moving things around in file explorer.

## Keyboard
- Using a Kinesis Advantage 2
  - Very ergonomic, good usage of thumbs
  - Has good macro support
- When pressing down the left foot every key one the keyboard turns into a macro
  - This mostly removes the need to press more than one key at once, reduces hand strain
- Use Colemak Mod DH - better layout than qwerty
  - Still use normal layout on a qwerty keyboard. Body is able to remember both and no issues switching. I don't touch type qwerty (and do colemak) so maybe that's why there is no confusion of muscle memory.

- Show off how various macros work
