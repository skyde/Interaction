# Goal

Ergonomic computer control without taking hands off keyboard. 

Uses eye tracking, footpedals and keyboard macros. Originally made for injured wrist, but is comfortable for day to day use.

# Keyboard

Avoid key chording, pressing more than one key at a time to reduce hand strain. 

Press left footpedal to turns every key into a macro; All common shortcuts a single keypress.

Keyboard layout is Colemak Mod DH rather than qwerty. I use a Kinesis Advantage 2 LF, a nice ergo keyboard.

# Footpedals

Left and right mouse clicks have been moved to the feet as the mouse is gaze based.

Shift has also been moved to the feet to remove chording when typing.

Left Foot:

Press and hold to activate alternate keyboard layout.

Right Foot:

Three Pedals. Left to right ordering:
- Shift Key
- Mouse Left Click
- Mouse Right Click

# Eye Gaze

Pressing the toggle eye mouse enables eye tracking to control the mouse purely with eye and head movement. This a custom program I wrote which based on Tobii eye tracking.

# Other

I also have a trackball attached on top of my Kinesis keyboard for fine mouse control. It's slightly offset to the left as it's used only by the left had.

Also have a vertical mouse since for some applications it's useful to have a regular mouse.
