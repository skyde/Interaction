# Interaction

Goal is to control computer fully without taking hands off of the keyboard, while being as ergonomic as possible. This was achieved for the most part, except for some use cases (ie. FPS games)

The input system ia combination of eye tracking, footpedals and keyboard macros.

Originally made due to an injured wrist, but turns out it's also very comfortable for day to day use.

# Keyboard

Avoids 'chords' (pressing more than one key at once) to reduces hand strain. Pressing the left footpedal turns every key into a macro, so all common shortcuts are a single keypress.

Keyboard layout is Colemak Mod DH, reduces hand fatigue compared to qwerty.

I use a Kinesis Advantage 2 LF, a very nice ergo keyboard.

# Footpedals

Left and right mouse clicks have been moved to the feet as the mouse is gaze based.

Shift has also been moved to the feet to remove chording when typing.

Left Foot:

Press and hold to activate alternate keyboard layout.

Right Foot:

Three Pedals. Left to right ordering:
- Shift Key
- Mouse Left Click
- Mouse Right Click

# Eye Gaze

Pressing the toggle eye mouse enables eye tracking to control the mouse purely with eye and head movement. This a custom program I wrote which based on Tobii eye tracking.

# Other

I also have a trackball attached on top of my Kinesis keyboard for fine mouse control. It's slightly offset to the left as it's used only by the left had.

Also have a vertical mouse since for some applications it's useful to have a regular mouse.
