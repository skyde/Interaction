# Goal

Ergonomic computer control with no mouse.

# Overview

Uses eye tracking, footpedals and keyboard macros.

Originally made for an injured wrist, but it is comfortable for day to day use as well.

# Eye Gaze

Eye tracking controls the cursor. Uses combination of eye and head movement for accurate control. Am able to use for professional programming work without issues.

(There are cases where I fall back to mouse usage. Testing a FPS game for example)

There are existing programs online that can do this, but I wrote a custom one myself as I found what was out there could be improved upon. 

Eye gaze is used to control the macro position of the mouse. Head horizontal and depth position are used for precise adjustments.

It takes a bit of time to get used, but after a few months it's just as natural as a regular mouse.

# Keyboard

One of the main sources of strain using a keyboard comes from pressing combinations of more than one key at a time (chording). 

To reduce this all common shortcuts have been moved to single keypress macros. Pressing down the left footpedal turns every key on the keyboard into a macro.

Keyboard layout is also Colemak Mod DH, an alternative to qwerty.

I also use a Kinesis Advantage 2 LF, a nice ergo keyboard.

# Footpedals

Mouse input position is gaze based, so there need to be a way to click the mouse. Mouse clicks have been moved to the feet.

I experimented with using blinking and winking to click, but found this was too distracting and not accurate enough.

Shift has also been moved to the feet as this further reduces 'chording' when typing.

Press and hold to activate alternate keyboard layout.

Right Foot:

Three Pedals. Left to right ordering:
- Shift Key
- Mouse Left Click
- Mouse Right Click

# Other

I also have a trackball to the middle of my keyboard for fine mouse control, as well as a vertical mouse as a fallback when normal mouse input is required.
