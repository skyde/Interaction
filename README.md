# Interaction

Goal is ability to control the computer fully without taking hands off of the keyboard, as well as being as ergonomic as possible. This was achieved for the most part, except for some use cases (ie. FPS games)

The input system uses a combination of eye tracking, footpedals and keyboard macros.

Original impetus to make this was an injured wrist, but turns out it's also very comfortable for day to day use.

# Keyboard

One of the main things to improve ease of input is to avoid 'chords' when inputting into the computer. Pressing down the left footpedal turns every key on the keyboard into a macro, so all common shortcuts are available.

I also use a keyboard layout called Colemak Mod DH, a more efficient keyboard layout compared to qwerty reducing hand fatigue.

I also use a Kinesis Advantage 2 LF keyboard. A very nice ergonomic keyboard.

# Footpedals

Left and right mouse clicks have been moved to the feet as the mouse is gaze based.

Shift has also been moved to the feet to remove chording when typing.

Left Foot:

Press and hold to activate alternate keyboard layout.

Right Foot:

Three Pedals. Left to right ordering:
- Shift Key
- Mouse Left Click
- Mouse Right Click

# Eye Gaze

Pressing the toggle eye mouse enables a custom program which uses Tobii eye tracking to control the mouse purely with eye and head movement.

# Other

I also have a trackball attached on top of my Kinesis keyboard for fine mouse control. It's slightly offset to the left as it's used only by the left had.

Also have a vertical mouse since for some applications it's useful to have a regular mouse.
