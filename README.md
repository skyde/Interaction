# Interaction

I have a custom input system setup into my computer using a combination of eye tracking, footpedals and macros on a keyboard. I injured my wrist for a while back and wanted to make an input system that put the least stress on my body.

Took about 3 months total of tweaking, but this was the result.

# Keyboard Layout
Layout I use for my Kinesis keyboard

# Footpedals

Left Foot:

Press and hold to activate alternate keyboard layout.

Right Foot:

Three Pedals. Left to right ordering:
- Shift Key
- Mouse Left Click
- Mouse Right Click

# Eye Gaze

By pressing the toggle eye mouse key (alternate layout left thumb) I enable eye gaze based mouse movement. This enables program I made using Tobii eye tracking to control the mouse purely with eye and head movement.

# Other

I also have a trackball attached on top of my Kinesis keyboard for fine mouse control. It's slightly offset to the left as it's used only by the left had.

Also have a vertical mouse since for some applications it's useful to have a regular mouse.
